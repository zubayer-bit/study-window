## STUDY_OPTIONS_IN_UK

Compared to many other parts of the world, the academic programme in the UK is typically shorter and more demanding. Because a degree can be earned in less time in the UK, many international students might decide to continue their studies there.

Students can choose from a wide variety of degree subjects at universities in the UK. In order to make the best decision, students must consider their academic background, language proficiency, and other factors. You can look into the available study fields in more detail by selecting one of the categories below. You can also get in touch with us to receive a personalised advisory upon request.

## PRE_SESSIONAL_ENGLISH

Pre-sessional English courses are offered at UK universities and colleges for foreign students who are coming to the country to pursue foundational, undergraduate, or postgraduate degrees. Before beginning a programme at a university, students may decide to enrol in this kind of course to raise their English proficiency or to fulfil the language requirements of their school.

Pre-sessional English courses, which range in length from two to twelve weeks, concentrate on academic English as well as UK history and culture.

---

## FOUNDATION

Some colleges and universities provide a one-year programme called a foundation degree. This course is for individuals who:

- lack the prerequisites for a bachelor's degree because they completed their secondary or high school education using a course of study that is not recognised by the university of their choice.
- Students whose performance is insufficient to meet the entry requirements for the field they wish to study.

Students enrolled in foundation courses are prepared academically for admission to a degree programme. Additionally, if necessary, students may get assistance with cultural adjustment, English language proficiency, and general study skills. Furthermore, foundation classes give students the chance to study their chosen subject at a university or college campus.

A conditional offer will typically be made to students enrolled in foundation courses by most universities that offer those courses within their institutions. This offer is contingent on students earning a specific overall mark, which they will be aware of from the moment they enroll in the foundation course.

It's crucial to keep in mind that not all universities and subject areas accept foundation diplomas. Before applying, make sure you understand the entry requirements for the course you want to take. Students might be required to apply to a college and take Level 3 course if foundation courses are not accepted.
