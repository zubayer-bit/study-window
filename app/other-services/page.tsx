      <h3>One-to-One Consultation</h3>
      <p>
        In order to help international students who want to study in London and
        the UK, Study Window offers high-quality, cost-free one-on-one
        consultations and application support services. European students are
        carefully consulted regarding their admissions and career objectives.
        Because every person is unique, we need to consult with others before
        determining which kind of support will work best for a given student.
      </p>

      <h3>University Selection</h3>
      <p>
        We are aware that deciding where to study and selecting the right
        university for admission are crucial choices. The teaching, research,
        innovation, and collaborative relationships at our UK universities have
        earned them a reputation as top international institutions.
        International students are welcome to study in London and the UK at our
        UK universities from everywhere in the world.
      </p>

      <h3>Course Selection</h3>
      <p>
        Through our partner's institution in the UK, we offer a wide range of
        subjects at foundation, undergraduate, and postgraduate levels up to
        higher education. We can assist students in selecting their programme of
        study with our guides outlining entry requirements. Applying for a
        programme at a UK University is simple with Study Window.
      </p>

      <h3>UCAS Application Help</h3>
      <p>
        Study Window is an official, recognised UCAS centre; therefore, we can
        provide you with free, independent advice on how to submit an
        appropriate, successful UCAS application. You must be aware of the UCAS
        application process because there are 100,000 undergraduate and
        postgraduate courses available, but each student only has a choice of
        five universities. It is imperative that you pick the appropriate
        university and course for you. Don’t make a mistake. Let Study Window
        help you.
