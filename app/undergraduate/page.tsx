        For full degrees, undergraduate/bachelor's degrees in the UK can be
        divided into the following categories:
      </p>
      <ul>

        <li>Bachelor of Science (BSc)</li>

      <ul>
        <li>Certificate of Higher Education (CertHE)</li>
        <li>Diploma of Higher Education (DipHE)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Most undergraduate degrees in the UK are completed in three years, but
        they can take anywhere from two to five years to complete, depending on
        the course you choose. Accelerated degrees are courses that last two
        years and are offered at some of Study Window's university partners. You
        can contact us to find out more.

      <p>
        Medicine and dentistry are among the five-year programmes offered in the
        UK. Occasionally, some courses might provide options for studying abroad
        or spending a year in industry. These supposedly sandwich courses last
        four years on average.

      <p>
        You should be aware that degrees in Scotland typically last four years.
