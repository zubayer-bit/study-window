      <p>
        Pre-sessional English courses are offered at UK universities and
        colleges for foreign students who are coming to the country to pursue
        foundational, undergraduate, or postgraduate degrees. Before beginning a
        programme at a university, students may decide to enrol in this kind of
        course to raise their English proficiency or to fulfil the language
        requirements of their school.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pre-sessional English courses, which range in length from two to twelve
        weeks, concentrate on academic English as well as UK history and
        culture.
