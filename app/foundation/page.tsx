      <p>
        Some colleges and universities provide a one-year programme called a
        foundation degree. This course is for individuals who:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          lack the prerequisites for a bachelor's degree because they completed
          their secondary or high school education using a course of study that
          is not recognised by the university of their choice.
        </li>
        <li>
          Students whose performance is insufficient to meet the entry
          requirements for the field they wish to study.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Students enrolled in foundation courses are prepared academically for
        admission to a degree programme. Additionally, if necessary, students
        may get assistance with cultural adjustment, English language
        proficiency, and general study skills. Furthermore, foundation classes
        give students the chance to study their chosen subject at a university
        or college campus.
